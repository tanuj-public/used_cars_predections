# Used Car Price Analysis

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze the factors that influence used car prices. We use a dataset of used car listings to identify key drivers of price and build a predictive model. The insights from this analysis can be valuable for used car dealers looking to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is `vehicles.csv`. It contains information about used car listings, including:

* `price`: The price of the car (target variable).
* `year`: The year the car was manufactured.
* `manufacturer`: The car's manufacturer.
* `model`: The car's model.
* Other features related to the car's condition, specifications, and location.

## Methodology

The analysis follows a typical data science workflow:

1.  **Data Understanding:** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming the data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing potential outliers.
3.  **Modeling:** Building and evaluating various regression models to predict car prices. We explored Linear Regression and Ridge Regression, along with techniques like feature engineering and feature selection.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models and interpreting the results to gain insights into the factors that drive used car prices.
5.  **Deployment:** Summarizing the findings in a report that can be presented to used car dealers.

## Key Findings

* Car model and year of manufacture are the strongest predictors of used car prices.
* Other factors like condition, fuel type, and mileage also have some influence.
* Linear models have limitations in accurately predicting prices, suggesting that non-linear relationships might be present in the data.

## Files

* `vehicles.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
* `[Jupyter Notebook or Python script]`: The code used for the analysis (replace this with the actual name of your notebook or script).
* `README.txt`: This file.
* `[report.txt or report.pdf]`: The report summarizing the findings (if you have a separate report file).

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy).
3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis.
